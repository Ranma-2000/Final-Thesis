This is the first time I try to completely create a full AI pipeline that will serve as a product.

In this utils folder, we will learn how to create and design utils folder and its files.

1. Importing files from different folder
  According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383571/importing-files-from-different-folder, folder that has __init__.py will be seen as a package.
  Pycharm will do it automatically, but in another IDE or other code editors, you might be need to add PYTHONPATH.
2. utils folder includes several utility functions, that are used throughout the projects.
